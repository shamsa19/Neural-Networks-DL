# Introduction to TensorFlow, Deep Learning and Transfer Learning

Project: Dog Vision üê∂üëÅ - Using computer vision to classify dog photos into different breeds.
Goals: Learn TensorFlow, deep learning and transfer learning, beat the original research paper results (22% accuracy).

Domain: Computer vision.
Data: Images of dogs from Stanford Dogs Dataset (120 dog breeds, 20,000+ images).
Problem type: Multi-class classification (120 different classes).
Runtime: This project is designed to run end-to-end in Google Colab (for free GPU access and easy setup). If you'd like to run it locally, it will require environment setup.
Demo: See a demo of the trained model running on Hugging Face Spaces.
